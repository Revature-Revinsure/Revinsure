# Revinsure
=======
Revinsure is a insurance claim application that allows for patients to file a claim or post on our discussion boards. With the recent pandemic of Covid-19 we have also included a form for patients to fill out concerning if they have had, currently have, or have been exposed to the virus recently. Along with patients we have employees who will in the future have the ability to aprove or deny the claims made by patients.

-----------
1. Login a user with an email and password
2. Register a new user with email, password, and user information
3. Have a patient who can update user information

5. Patients may also file an insurance claim
6. Patients will also fill out a Covid-19 Verification form upon creating an account 
7. Have a Employee who can maintain and update information
